# my_pet_tables
This is the collection of my own JavaScript ECMA 6 tables and examples how to combine them with Python Flask application. Inspired by Google Charts library.

Primarly I work with Flask + Jinja2. Jinja2 is a perfect server side page-rendering library, but if you would like to provide interactivity to page you always need Javascript. There are a great number of free and paid JavaScript Table Libraries, but in the repository I tried to create Tables which will use new JavaScripts ECMA6 Class paradigm, and to provide users with full control of library code with wide range of comments how each blcok of the code is used. 

**Features:**

1. Really reusable OOP JavaScript ECMA 6 code - no copy paste in each of your js file or html page, like you see in many tutorials;

2. You can define any style for your tables, but functionality will stay the same;

3. Code style is based on PEP and will be understandable for Python Developers;

4. No Frameworks is used, just JavaScript ECMA 6;

5. Open Source - fork the repository and create your own tables based on the existent code.

**Contributation to the Project:**

2. Feel free to contribute in documentation;

3. Feel free to contribute in Flask example;
